# MVC-tech-blog

## Description

I've created this Tech Blog to showcase my ever-growing skills and knowledge of MVC structure and how to implement it. This app is very much bare-bones when it comes to it's styling, so css was definitely not my strong point with this challenge. However, despite it's lackluster appearance, you'll find that the application runs smoothly. The user post/login/logout routes are configured to only allow a user who's logged in to comment/post/view their profile. Thanks to env and JAWSDB, their information is saved via a timed session, which gives the user security within the site. The handlebars for html formatting was a very interesting way to layout our index.html components. I had a very tricky time with syntax on this project and it plagued me throughout. Thankfully, I was able to complete this project with only 100+ extra grey hairs than I had in the beginning. I hope whomever comes across this endeavor will be able to fully understand and follow my code!

## Usage

![GIF of deployed MVC tech blog](<public/assets/images/Untitled_ Sep 1, 2023 4_23 PM.gif>)

To use the deployed site, open up ![the MVC tech blog](<https://mustache-tech-blog-de30bf0b9a4c.herokuapp.com/>) in your browser window. You're greeted by a blank homepage. To be directed to the login/signup page, the user must click 'login', located on the upper right corner of the page. When redirected to this page, a returning user can login here, or a new user may signup here instead. After logging in, the user is taken to their profile page, and from here they can add/delete a post with a description and time stamp. To see the post on the homepage, a user can click 'MVC tech blog' located in the upper left corner of the page. When on the homepage, once a post is clicked, the user can leave a comment, with a date stamp. Once a user completes their post/comments, they can either click 'Profile' or 'logout' to be redirected to the pages of their choosing. Happy Coding!
